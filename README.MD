# PE-DCNN:
This repository contains our source code of the paper "Impact Analysis of Different Effective Loss Functions by Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Face Recognition"

# Update

# Requirements:
We use Python 3.8.10. To install all dependencies, run:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Datasets
- We use CASIA-Webface  for training and some available test sets including LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, CALFW, CPLFW for benchmark. All datasets is contributed from [Insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/_datasets_)
- Download and extract into _data_ folder. 

# Experiments
You can run directly the code by files in _scripts_ folder 

```python
Example: bash scripts/train.sh
```
